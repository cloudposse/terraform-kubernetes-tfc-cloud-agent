    version        = "~> 1.12"
  }

  module "tfc_agent" {
    source = "https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-kubernetes-tfe-cloud-agent.git?ref=master"

    # Your agent token generated in Terraform Cloud
    token       = var.tcf_agent_token
    namespace   = var.namespace
    stage       = var.stage
    environment = var.environment
    name        = var.name

    # You can specify a namespace other than "default"
